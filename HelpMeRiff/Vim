Vim
===

Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X. 



Modes:
======

- Normal: When you enter vim, you are by default in the "Normal" mode, here you can copy lines and enter into other modes

- Insert: In this mode you can modify the content of your file. You can enter it by pressing i.

- Command: You can access this mode by pressing "Esc" and then ":". In this mode you can search and replace expressions, save, exit vim, change session parameters...

- Visual: You can enter this mode pressing "v" from normal mode, once in it you can select text but not modify it.

- Select: From visual mode, press "Ctrl-G", now you can select and replace text

- Ex: Enter this mode from Normal mode, by pressing Q. Here you can execute several vim commands without exiting back to Normal mode every time.
