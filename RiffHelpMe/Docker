Docker
======

The Docker platform leverages Docker containers to enable IT operations teams and Developement teams to build, ship and run any application, anywhere.


Use:
===

- Download image from DockerHub:
	sudo docker pull image-name

- List all images:
	sudo docker images

- Run an image:
	sudo docker run image-name

- Run an image and keep attached to its command line:
	docker run -it image-name /bin/bash

- Run an image in background:
	sudo doker run -d --name name-of-the-job image-name

- Remove an image:
	sudo docker rmi image-name

- List running containers:
	sudo docker ps

- List all containers:
	sudo docker -a

- Stop a container:
	sudo docker stop container-ID

- Remove a container:
	sudo docker rm container-ID

- Save changes to container:
	sudo docker commit -m "comments" container-ID image-name:label-name

After this last command, a new image is created, we can run it with:
	sudo docker run -it image-name:label-name
